- Quilix is an AI-powered web application that converts unstructured scanned PDFs of PYQs into structured, searchable, and analyzable digital content. It allows students and faculty to upload past papers, validate their metadata, and use OCR and AI to tag individual questions by module, marks, type, and patterns. Over time, the system builds a centralized question database per college, enabling smart trends analysis, chapter-wise preparation, and automated grouping of similar questions. It’s built to scale across colleges using a modular role-based approach.
